# Yeenbilight

Yeebilight is a personal adaptation of the concept Ambilight from Philips and there Philips Hue lights.
This Java application will allow the user to connect his Xiaomi Yeelight hardware to the content on is computer screen.

## How it works ?
Basically, I'm connecting the Yeelights to a TCP server, which is taking screens on the computer.
Then he computes the RGB average value of the screenshot and asks the lights to take this color.

## Objectives
The final objective is to take different area on the image and allow lights to take different colors around the screen for immersion.
